# Ether Harvest

## Install

Executing the `yarn` command should install all the dependencies

## Tests

The command `truffle test` command will run all the truffle tests, those are
the ones located under the `test` folder.

In order to run the tests `ganache` or `ganache-cli` should be running (or
another etherum client, but we use `ganache`).

## Running the WebApp

The project uses `create-react-app` so to run the test server just execute the
`yarn start` command.
